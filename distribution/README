The UNICORE Commandline Client (UCC) is a full-featured client
for accessing UNICORE services.

It requires a Java runtime environment, version 11 or later.
We recommend using the OpenJDK.

UCC offers

 * Job submission and management 

 * Data movement (upload, download, server-to-server copy, etc) using
   the UNICORE storage management functions and the available data
   transfer protocols

 * Storage functions (ls, mkdir, ...) including creation of storage
   instances via storage factories

 * UNICORE Workflow service support

and much more.
