   UNICORE storage management functions and available data transfer protocols

 * Storage functions (ls, mkdir, ...) including creation of storage instances
   via storage factories

 * Support for UNICORE workflow submission and management

 * Support for the UNICORE metadata system
 
 * Support for sharing UNICORE resources via ACLs

   in the Groovy programming language
