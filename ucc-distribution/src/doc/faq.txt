Frequently asked questions
--------------------------


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

==== Do I really have to store my password in the preferences file? Isn't this insecure?

Putting the password in a file or giving it as a commandline parameter can be considered 
insecure. The file could be read by others, and the commandline parameters may be visible 
in for example in the output of the 'ps' command.  
Thus, UCC will simply ask for the password in case you did not specify it.

==== How can I enable more detailed logging?

UCC uses log4j, by default the configuration is done in <UCC_HOME>/conf/logging.properties
You can edit this file and increase the logging levels, choose to log to a file or to the 
console, etc.


Usage
~~~~~

==== Can I use multiple registries with UCC?
  
Yes. Simply use a comma-separated list of URLs for the "-c" option. However, you 
may only use a single key/truststore, so all registries (and sites listed in 
them) must accept the same security credentials. 
  
==== Can I upload and execute my own executable?

Yes. Check xref:ucc_jobs[].
  
==== Can I use UCC to list the contents of the registry?

Using the 'rest' command (and the UNIX 'jq' utility for formatting the output),
this is very easy, for example

--------------
ucc rest get https://localhost:8080/DEMO-SITE/rest/core/registries/default_registry | jq
--------------

will list the content of the registry.
