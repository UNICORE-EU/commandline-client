Workflows

=== Introduction


UCC supports the UNICORE workflow system and allows to submit workflows to
the workflow engine and manage them.

The workflows are executed server-side, and UCC is used only for submitting, 
managing data and getting results.

[NOTE]
===========
Version 8 of the workflow system has changed a lot, and is still evolving
- as is the UCC support. Stay tuned for updates!

=== Command overview

The following commands are provided. More details and examples follow below.
  
  - +workflow-submit+ : submit a workflow file
  
  - +workflow-control+ :  abort or resume a running workflow 
  
  - +list-workflows+ : list information about workflows
  
=== Basic use

To check the availability of workflow services, issue the following command

-------------
ucc system-info -l
-------------

This should show at least an accessible workflow service.

The distribution contains some example workflow files in the <<<samples/workflows>>> directory 
that you can edit and submit.
  
-------------
ucc workflow-submit yourworkflow.json
-------------

which will submit the workflow and print the address of the workflow to standard output.
To get the workflow status,

---------------
ucc list-workflows <workflow_address>
---------------  


To list all your workflows, you can use the <<<list-workflows>>> command without an explicit
workflow address

---------------
ucc list-workflows -l
---------------  
   
  
=== Managing workflow data


==== Importing local data for use by a workflow

TBD

If you have local files that need to be imported before starting
the workflow, you have to specify this using a normal UCC job file that 
contains only an "Imports" section:

==== Workflow templates

TBD

If the workflow's +Documentation+ section contains +parameters+ definitions, the corresponding
replacement will be done by reading parameter values from the .u file. These so-called
workflow templates can be a very simple and safe way to make adjustments in complex workflows #
before submission. As an example, consider the following simple example workflow

=== Resuming a held workflow

A workflow in status "HELD" can be resumed using the "workflow-control resume" command. If the workflow
has variables / parameters, updated values can be sent with the resume command.
