ucc-mode
========


Prerequisites
=============

It is recommended to use ucc-mode with GNU Emacs 22 or later. 

However, it will run with GNU Emacs 21 as well, but be aware that you
will miss some features. We have tested ucc-mode with GNU Emacs 21, 22
and 23 on both Linux and Windows XP, other Emacsen or operating
systems may or may not work. ;-)


Quick start
===========

In order to use ucc-mode, you have to configure a few lines in your
.emacs file. First, you have to tell emacs where it can find the
ucc-*.el files. For example, if you put them in ~/elisp, add the
line::

  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp")

Now let Emacs load the files::

  (require 'ucc-mode)

This will not activate ucc-mode, it only makes Emacs aware of the
commands the mode provides. Now tell Emacs where to find your ucc
executable, e.g.:

  (setq ucc-command "~/bin/ucc")

That's it, now you can access the ucc-* commands. For example, type::

  M-x ucc-connect

There's also a minor-mode which gives you a nice menu and keybord
shortcuts for the ucc-* commands, activate it like this:

  M-x ucc-mode


Further configuration
=====================

If you want Emacs to load ucc-mode automatically for all files ending
with .u, add the following line to you .emacs file:

  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.u$" . ucc-mode))

If you want Emacs to load xml-mode *and* ucc-mode automatically for all
files ending with .swf, add the following line to you .emacs file:

(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.swf$" . (lambda ()
					      (xml-mode)
					      (ucc-mode t))))


Here are examples of further configuration, see the online help of the
respective variables for documentation:

  (setq ucc-flags "-v")
  (setq ucc-flags "-v -c ~/.ucc/my_preferences")
  (setq ucc-flags "") ;; The default

  (setq ucc-reuse-buffer nil)
  (setq ucc-reuse-buffer t) ;; The default

  (set-face-foreground 'ucc-epr "blue")
  (set-face-foreground 'ucc-epr-mouse "blue")
  (set-face-background 'ucc-epr-mouse nil)

Note that ucc-mode provides its own group, you can customize all the
variables via:

  M-x customize-group ucc

instead.


Compiling
=========

You can byte-compile the ucc-*.el files to speed up loading and usage
of the ucc-* commands. However, since the ucc executable itself is
the slowest part in the chain, the effect may be rather small. Use
the following lines for byte-compiling:

  (byte-compile-file "ucc-mode.el")
  (byte-compile-file "ucc-output-mode.el")
  (byte-compile-file "ucc-localfilelist-mode.el")

If you are viewing this file in Emacs, you can just mark the above
lines and invoke:

  M-x eval-region
