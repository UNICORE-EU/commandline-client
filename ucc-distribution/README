The UNICORE Commandline client (UCC) is a full-featured client for the
UNICORE Grid middleware. 

It requires a Java runtime environment. We recommend using the latest
OpenJDK or Oracle Java.

For Oracle or IBM Java, you will usually need to install the
"unlimited strength cryptography" policy files. Otherwise, you
will encounter "illegal key size" error messages.

UCC offers

 * Job submission and management for both UNICORE native and OGSA-BES
   interfaces

 * Data movement (upload, download, server-to-server copy, etc) using
   the UNICORE storage management functions and available data
   transfer protocols

 * Storage functions (ls, mkdir, ...) including creation of storage
   instances via storage factories

 * UNICORE workflow system support

and much more.
